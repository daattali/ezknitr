Time: `r date()`

Where am I? My working directory is:

`r getwd()`


I like to assume the directory containing the 'R' and 'data' folders is the
working directory.  Let's try to read a file from the 'data' folder.

```{r }
dat <- scan("data/numbers.txt", quiet = TRUE)
```

How many numbers were read from the input?

```{r }
length(dat)
```

(If you see errors when using `spin`, that's expected - it's because the
working directory was not what the script assumed.)

A plot:

```{r noecho, echo = FALSE}
plot(1:10)
```
