#' Avoid the Typical Working Directory Pain When Using 'knitr'
#' 
#' \code{ezknitr} is an extension of \code{knitr} that adds flexibility in several
#' ways. One common source of frustration with \code{knitr} is that it assumes
#' the directory where the source file lives should be the working directory,
#' which is often not true. \code{ezknitr} addresses this problem by giving you
#' complete control over where all the inputs and outputs are, and adds several
#' other convenient features to make rendering markdown/HTML documents easier.
